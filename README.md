**Complexity Analysis for task number 2**
- Time Complexity:
  The function processes each character in the input string exactly once, making it an 𝑂(𝑛)
  O(n) operation, where 𝑛 is the length of the string.
- Space Complexity:
  The space complexity is 𝑂(𝑛)
  O(n) because, in the worst case, all characters in the string could be opening brackets, requiring the stack to store all n characters.
